# Hi, I'm Cameron.

I'm a software engineer based in New York City. I've worked at [Check][k], [Google][p], [Oyster][o] and [Aviary][a]. I believe creativity and tenacity are the key ingredients to creating great software products (along with some code, of courseâ€”ideally Python!). In my free time I enjoy watching movies and TV, running, and biking around the city.

Feel free to get in touch at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}). You can also find me on [Threads][t] and [GitHub][g].
